Shape Keys+ (Taco's Fork)
===========
###### Shape Keys Plus Custom

A modified version of Michael Glen Montague's [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on [Shape Keys+](https://github.com/MichaelGlenMontague/shape_keys_plus) with an expanded feature set.

Currently only Blender 2.79 compatible, the goal of this repository is to eventually update my fork to the modern Blender api.
